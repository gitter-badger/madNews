<p> The User Management service enables you to create and manage login credentials for each user. You can also limit the merchant accounts that each user can access, together with the available functionality.
Only one username and password is required to access all applications that are available to the user.
You can control, for example:
The applications a user can access
Whether access is read-only
If a user can update information
The features a user can access within the Merchant Interface, if applicable
The merchant codes that each user can access, if you have multiple accounts
</p>
<p>User Management:
Contributes to the overall security of your business
Makes it easier for your users to access the pages they need
Simplifies deployment of our services within your organisation
